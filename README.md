I just wanted my own installer for my personal use. Something stripped out to the bare minumum.

You can try to use this at your own risks, i recomand you checking out other launcher such as [viper](https://github.com/0neGal/viper) or [VTOL](https://github.com/R2NorthstarTools/VTOL) if you are not sure on what to use.

## Building

If you want to build the installer yourself, simply open the visual studio solution and generate the project.

Project was made with Visual Studio 2019 and Windows SDK 10.0.20348.0, but it should work without these exact versions.
